GRAD C6 2001 - Statistics II - Assignment 1
-------------

Due by 11:59 pm on Sunday, February 9.


## Submission of Assignments

This homework is due by the date and time specified above. You are encouraged to collaborate with others on the solutions, but have to write up and submit your own files, which you host on your personal repository. 

The final product for this assignment should be 

1. An Rmd document named `assignment-X.Rmd` (X to be replaced with assignment number) that contains all code and text for the tasks described above, as well as 
2. A knitted HTML version of that document named `assignment-X.html` (X to be replaced with assignment number). 

Please make use of the template Rmd file in your repository and DO NOT RENAME IT. 

The documents should be clearly and cleanly formated and present all of your results. Please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your text and code are properly formated. 

## Submission of Reviews

The final product for the two anonymous reviews you get assigned every week should be

1. An Rmd document named `assignment-X-reviewer-feedback.Rmd` (X to be replaced with assignment number) that contains the scores for each task as well as verbal feedback on the individual tasks.

Please make use of the template Rmd files in the aut folders in your repository and DO NOT RENAME THEM. 

## Submission of Review Ratings

At the end of the process, you as the recipient of two reviews have the chance to rate the feedback from the reviewers along two dimensions: accuracy and helpfulness. To do so, please make use of the rating form `assignment-X-author-rating.Rmd`(X to be replaced with assignment number) and score the reviews on scales.



## Timeline and Deadlines

To make sure that the peer review process works smoothly, it is extremely important that you comply with the submission deadlines. They are as follows:

0. The new assignment will published every Tuesday until 1pm.

1. Submit your solutions by committing the modified Rmd file as well as the knitted HTML file to GitHub until Sunday, 11:59pm. For each hour the assignment is turned in late, the grade will be reduced by 10% (e.g. submission two hours after the deadline would result in 20% grade deduction).

2. You will be assigned (anonymous) solutions from two of your peers for review every Monday until 1pm. At the same time, the solutions will be posted online as a guideline for the review. 

3. Submit your (anonymous) review feedback sheets until Tuesday, 11:59pm. 

4. Consult the feedback you received and submit the review rating sheets until Sunday, 11:59pm.


## Coding Style

In this class we will not be enforcing any particular coding style, however it is important that the code you produce is *readable* and *consistent* in its formating. There are several R style guides online, e.g. from [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml) and from [Hadley Wickham](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/style.html).
